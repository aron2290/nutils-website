description: |
  This simulation solves a thermoelasticity problem using Nutils.
  It computes displacement and temperature distributions in a 3D solid under 
  thermal and mechanical loading.

  The results include:
  - Displacement Magnitude Plot (showing deformation)
  - Temperature Distribution Plot (showing heat conduction effects)
  - An export to .vtk format, for further analysis in e.g. Paraview

  The simulation is based on finite element methods (FEM) and leverages 
  the Nutils library for efficient numerical solutions.
