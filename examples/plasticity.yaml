description: |
  This example considers the plastic deformation of a perforated strip. More
  information regarding this prototypical nonlinear solid mechanics problem
  can be found in, for example, ["The Finite Element Method for Solid and
  Structural Mechanics" by Zienkiewicz and Taylor][ZieTay2014].
